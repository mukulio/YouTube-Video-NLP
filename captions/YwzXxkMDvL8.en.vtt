00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.649
BOB SCHIEFFER: Good evening from the campus
of Lynn University here in Boca Raton, Florida.

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.960
This is the fourth and last debate of the
2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.340
on Presidential Debates. This one’s on foreign
policy. I’m Bob Schieffer of CBS News. The

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.970
questions are mine, and I have not shared
them with the candidates or their aides.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.350
The audience has taken a vow of silence — no
applause, no reaction of any kind except right

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:52.350
now when we welcome President Barack Obama
and Governor Mitt Romney. (Sustained cheers,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:09.300
applause.) Gentlemen, your campaigns have
agreed to certain rules and they are simple.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.070
They have asked me to divide the evening into
segments. I’ll pose a question at the beginning

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.900
of each segment. You will each have two minutes
to respond, and then we will have a general

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.610
discussion until we move to the next segment.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.880
Tonight’s debate, as both of your know,
comes on the 50th anniversary of the night

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.340
that President Kennedy told the world that
the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.340
in Cuba — perhaps the closest we’ve ever
come to nuclear war. And it is a sobering

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.630
reminder that every president faces at some
point an unexpected threat to our national

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.810
security from abroad. So let’s begin.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.210
The first segment is the challenge of a changing
Middle East and the new face of terrorism.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.990
I’m going to put this into two segments,
so you’ll have two topic questions within

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:10.189
this one segment on that subject. The first
question, and it concerns Libya, the controversy

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:15.730
over what happened there continues. Four Americans
are dead, including an American ambassador.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.730
Questions remain. What happened? What caused
it? Was it spontaneous?

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.349
Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy
failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.829
about what really happened?

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.920
Governor Romney, you said this was an example
of an American policy in the Middle East that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.519
is unraveling before our very eyes. I’d
like to hear each of you give your thoughts

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.870
on that.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.999
Governor Romney, you won the toss. You go
first.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.739
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Bob, and thank you
for agreeing to moderate this debate this

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.980
evening. Thank you to Lynn University for
welcoming us here, and Mr. President, it’s

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.849
good to be with you again. We were together
at a humorous event a little earlier, and

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.430
it’s nice to maybe be funny this time not
on purpose. We’ll see what happens. (Laughter.)

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.089
This is obviously an area of great concern
to the entire world and to America in particular,

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:13.730
which is to see a — a complete change in
the — the — the structure and the — the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.370
environment in the Middle East. With the Arab
Spring came a great deal of hope that there

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.900
would be a change towards more moderation
and opportunity for greater participation

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.800
on the part of women and — and public life
and in economic life in the Middle East. But

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.529
instead we’ve seen in nation after nation
a number of disturbing events. Of course,

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:40.129
we see in Syria 30,000 civilians having been
killed by the military there. We see in — in

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.269
— in Libya an attack apparently by — well,
I think we know now by terrorists of some

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.040
kind against — against our people there,
four people dead. Our hearts and minds go

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.819
to them. Mali has been taken over, the northern
part of Mali, by al-Qaida-type individuals.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.279
We have in — in Egypt a Muslim Brotherhood
president.

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.749
And so what we’re seeing is a — a — a
pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.620
we had for that region. Of course, the greatest
threat of all is Iran, four years closer to

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.869
a nuclear weapon. And — and we’re going
to have to recognize that we have to do as

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:18.319
the president has done. I congratulate him
on — on taking out Osama bin Laden and going

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.150
after the leadership in al-Qaida. But we can’t
kill our way out of this mess. We’re — we’re

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.960
going to have to put in place a very comprehensive
and robust strategy to help the — the world

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.910
of Islam and — and other parts of the world
reject this radical violent extremism which

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.289
is — it’s really not on the run. It’s
certainly not hiding. This is a group that

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.129
is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and
it presents an enormous threat to our friends,

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.349
to the world, to America long term, and we
must have a comprehensive strategy to help

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.280
reject this kind of extremism.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.520
MR. SCHIEFFER: Mr. President.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.830
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, my first job as commander
in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.560
safe, and that’s what we’ve done over
the last four years. We ended the war in Iraq,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.120
refocused our attention on those who actually
killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, al-Qaida’s

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.180
core leadership has been decimated.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.181
In addition, we’re now able to transition
out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making

00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:25.259
sure that Afghans take responsibility for
their own security, and that allows us also

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:34.310
to rebuild alliances and make friends around
the world to combat future threats. Now, with

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.280
respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last
debate, when we received that phone call,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.569
I immediately made sure that, number one,
we did everything we could to secure those

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.599
Americans who were still in harm’s way;
number two, that we would investigate exactly

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.289
what happened; and number three, most importantly,
that we would go after those who killed Americans,

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.840
and we would bring them to justice, and that’s
exactly what we’re going to do.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.110
But I think it’s important to step back
and think about what happened in Libya. Now,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:11.460
keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership
in organizing an international coalition that

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.430
made sure that we were able to — without
putting troops on the ground, at the cost

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.840
of less than what we spent in two weeks in
Iraq — liberate a country that had been

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.990
under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years,
got rid of a despot who had killed Americans.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.699
And as a consequence, despite this tragedy,
you had tens of thousands of Libyans after

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:40.249
the events in Benghazi marching and saying,
America’s our friend. We stand with them.

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.130
Now that represents the opportunity we have
to take advantage of. And you know, Governor

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.639
Romney, I’m glad that you agree that we
have been successful in going after al-Qaida,

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:57.110
but I have to tell you that, you know, your
strategy previously has been one that has

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.560
been all over the map and is not designed
to keep Americans safe or to build on the

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.530
opportunities that exist in the Middle East.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.890
MR. ROMNEY: Well, my strategy’s pretty straightforward,
which is to go after the bad guys, to make

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.840
sure we do our very best to interrupt them,
to — to kill them, to take them out of the

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.270
picture. But my strategy is broader than — than
that. That’s — that’s important, of

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.569
course, but the key that we’re going to
have to pursue is a — is a pathway to — to

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:27.069
get the Muslim world to be able to reject
extremism on its own. We don’t want another

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.800
Iraq. We don’t want another Afghanistan.
That’s not the right course for us. The

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.370
right course for us is to make sure that we
go after the — the people who are leaders

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.949
of these various anti-American groups and
these — these jihadists, but also help the

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:40.949
Muslim world.

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:45.020
And how we do that? A group of Arab scholars
came together, organized by the U.N., to look

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:52.009
at how we can help the — the world reject
these — these terrorists. And the answer

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:53.189
they came up was this.

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:58.219
One, more economic development. We should
key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:02.320
and that of our friends — we should coordinate
it to make sure that we — we push back and

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.090
give them more economic development.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.120
Number two, better education.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.169
Number three, gender equality.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:12.979
Number four, the rule of law. We have to help
these nations create civil societies.

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:17.389
But what’s been happening over the last
couple years as we watched this tumult in

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:23.170
the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos
occur, you see al-Qaida rushing in, you see

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.610
other jihadist groups rushing in.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.349
And — and they’re throughout many nations
of the Middle East.

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:33.659
It’s wonderful that Libya seems to be making
some progress, despite this terrible tragedy,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:39.539
but next door, of course, we have Egypt. Libya’s
6 million population, Egypt 80 million population.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.260
We want — we want to make sure that we’re
seeing progress throughout the Middle East.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:49.019
With Mali now having North Mali taken over
by al-Qaida, with Syria having Assad continuing

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:54.480
to — or to kill — to murder his own people,
this is a region in tumult. And of course

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.420
Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon. We’ve
got real gaps in the region.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.430
MR. SCHIEFFER: We’ll get to that, but let’s
give the president a chance.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.190
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor Romney, I’m glad
that you recognize that al-Qaida’s a threat

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.110
because a few months ago when you were asked,
what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:14.010
America, you said Russia — not al-Qaida,
you said Russia. And the 1980s are now calling

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.240
to ask for their foreign policy back because,
you know, the Cold War’s been over for 20

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
years.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.850
But, Governor, when it comes to our foreign
policy, you seem to want to import the foreign

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.690
policies of the 1980s, just like the social
policies of the 1950s and the economic policies

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.810
of the 1920s. You say that you’re not interested
in duplicating what happened in Iraq, but

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.620
just a few weeks ago you said you think we
should have more troops in Iraq right now.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.399
And the — the challenge we have — I know
you haven’t been in a position to actually

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:48.510
execute foreign policy, but every time you’ve
offered an opinion, you’ve been wrong. You

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.149
said we should have gone into Iraq despite
the fact that there were no weapons of mass

00:09:53.149 --> 00:10:00.880
destruction. You said that we should still
have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:08.980
that we shouldn’t be passing nuclear treaties
with Russia, despite the fact that 71 senators,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.000
Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.699
You’ve said that first we should not have
a timeline in Afghanistan then you said we

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:23.529
should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which
means not only were you wrong but you were

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:27.570
also confusing and sending mixed messages
both to our troops and our allies.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:33.880
So what — what we need to do with respect
to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.320
not wrong and reckless leadership that is
all over the map. And unfortunately, that’s

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.720
the kind of opinions that you’ve offered
throughout this campaign, and it is not a

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.079
recipe for American strength or keeping America
safe over the long term.

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.120
MR. SCHIEFFER: I’m going to add a couple
of minutes here to give you a chance to respond.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.930
MR. ROMNEY: Well, of course I don’t concur
with what the president said about my own

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.889
record and the things that I’ve said. They
don’t happen to be accurate. But — but

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:04.100
I can say this: that we’re talking about
the Middle East and how to help the Middle

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.450
East reject the kind of terrorism we’re
seeing and the rising tide of tumult and — and

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:13.930
confusion. And — and attacking me is not
an agenda. Attacking me is not talking about

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.940
how we’re going to deal with the challenges
that exist in the Middle East and take advantage

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:22.120
of the opportunity there and stem the tide
of this violence. But I’ll respond to a

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.160
couple of the things you mentioned. First
of all, Russia, I indicated, is a geopolitical

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.191
foe, not —

00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:29.191
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Number one —

00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:32.360
MR. ROMNEY: Excuse me. It’s a geopolitical
foe. And I said in the same — in the same

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:37.690
paragraph, I said, and Iran is the greatest
national security threat we face. Russia does

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.810
continue to battle us in the U.N. time and
time again. I have clear eyes on this. I’m

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.800
not going to wear rose-colored glasses when
it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin, and I’m

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.350
certainly not going to say to him, I’ll
give you more flexibility after the election.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.329
After the election he’ll get more backbone.

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:56.230
Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and
I agreed, I believe, that there should have

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.370
been a status of forces agreement. Did you
— PRESIDENT OBAMA: That’s not true.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.200
MR. ROMNEY: Oh, you didn’t — you didn’t
want a status of forces agreement?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.050
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, but what I — what I
would not have done is left 10,000 troops

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.019
in Iraq that would tie us down. That certainly
would not help us in the Middle East.

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:10.820
MR. ROMNEY: I’m sorry, you actually — there
was a —

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.820
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Here — here is — here
is —

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.570
MR. ROMNEY: There was an effort on the part
of the president to have a status of forces

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.339
agreement. And I concurred in that and said
we should have some number of troops that

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:19.610
stayed on. That was something I concurred
with.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:20.610
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor —

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.370
MR. ROMNEY: That was your posture. That was
my posture as well.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.459
I thought it should have been 5,000 troops.

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:24.459
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor —

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:25.459
MR. ROMNEY: I thought it should have been
more troops. But you — (inaudible).

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:26.459
PRESIDENT OBAMA: This is just a few weeks
ago.

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:28.209
MR. ROMNEY: The answer was, we got no troop
(through ?) whatsoever.

00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:31.130
PRESIDENT OBAMA: This is just a few weeks
ago that you indicated that we should still

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.130
have troops in Iraq.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.590
MR. ROMNEY: No, I didn’t. I’m sorry, that’s
—

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.050
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You made a major speech.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.089
MR. ROMNEY: I indicated — I indicated that
you failed to put in place a status of forces

00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:40.740
agreement at the end of the conflict that
—

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.920
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor —

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.160
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor, here’s — here’s
one thing — here’s one thing — here’s

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.362
one thing I’ve learned as commander in chief.

00:12:45.362 --> 00:12:46.362
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let him have — (inaudible).

00:12:46.362 --> 00:12:51.319
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You’ve got to be clear,
both to our allies and our enemies, about

00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:55.980
where you stand and what you mean. Now, you
just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:01.550
you said we should still have troops in Iraq.
That is not a recipe for making sure that

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:06.630
we are taking advantage of the opportunities
and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.760
Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot
just beat these challenges militarily, and

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.851
so what I’ve done throughout my presidency
and will continue to do, is, number one, make

00:13:16.851 --> 00:13:21.900
sure that these countries are supporting our
counterterrorism efforts; number two, make

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.839
sure that they are standing by our interests
in Israel’s security, because it is a true

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:32.079
friend and our greatest ally in the region.
Number three, we do have to make sure that

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:35.830
we’re protecting religious minorities and
women because these countries can’t develop

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:41.230
unless all the population — not just half
of it — is developing. Number four, we do

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:46.750
have to develop their economic — their economic
capabilities. But number five, the other thing

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:52.790
that we have to do is recognize that we can’t
continue to do nation building in these regions.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.140
Part of American leadership is making sure
that we’re doing nation building here at

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:01.629
home. That will help us maintain the kind
of American leadership that we need.

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:06.649
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let me interject the second
topic question in this segment about the Middle

00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:12.940
East and so on, and that is, you both mentioned
— alluded to this, and that is Syria. The

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.629
war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon.
We have, what, more than a hundred people

00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:22.540
that were killed there in a bomb. There were
demonstrations there, eight people dead.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.580
Mr. President, it’s been more than a year
since you saw — you told Assad he had to

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:35.230
go. Since then 30,000 Syrians have died. We’ve
had 300,000 refugees. The war goes on. He’s

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:43.339
still there. Should we reassess our policy
and see if we can find a better way to influence

00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:47.450
events there, or is that even possible? And
it’s you — you go first, sir.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.700
PRESIDENT OBAMA: What we’ve done is organize
the international community, saying Assad

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:59.090
has to go. We’ve mobilized sanctions against
that government. We have made sure that they

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:04.690
are isolated. We have provided humanitarian
assistance, and we are helping the opposition

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.019
organize, and we’re particularly interested
in making sure that we’re mobilizing the

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:13.959
moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately,
Syrians are going to have to determine their

00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:18.360
own future. And so everything we’re doing,
we’re doing in consultation with our partners

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.579
in the region, including Israel, which obviously
has a huge interest in seeing what happens

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:26.970
in Syria, coordinating with Turkey and other
countries in the region that have a great

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.259
interest in this.

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:33.399
Now, this — what we’re seeing taking place
in Syria is heartbreaking, and that’s why

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:37.870
we are going to do everything we can to make
sure that we are helping the opposition. But

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:44.319
we also have to recognize that, you know,
for us to get more entangled militarily in

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:50.340
Syria is a serious step. And we have to do
so making absolutely certain that we know

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.470
who we are helping, that we’re not putting
arms in the hands of folks who eventually

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.079
could turn them against us or our allies in
the region.

00:15:59.079 --> 00:16:05.689
And I am confident that Assad’s days are
numbered. But what we can’t do is to simply

00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:10.850
suggest that, as Governor Romney at times
has suggested, that giving heavy weapons,

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:16.209
for example, to the Syrian opposition is a
simple proposition that would lead us to be

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:17.430
safer over the long term.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.430
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.451
MR. ROMNEY: Well, let’s step back and talk
about what’s happening in Syria and how

00:16:21.451 --> 00:16:27.529
important it is. First of all, 30,000 people
being killed by their government is a humanitarian

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:28.529
disaster.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:33.550
Secondly, Syria’s an opportunity for us
because Syria plays an important role in the

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.500
Middle East, particularly right now. Syria
is Iran’s only ally in the Arab world. It’s

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.509
their route to the sea. It’s the route for
them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens,

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:49.540
of course, our ally Israel. And so seeing
Syria remove Assad is a very high priority

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.629
for us. Number two, seeing a — a replacement
government being responsible people is critical

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:58.450
for us. And finally, we don’t want to have
military involvement there. We don’t want

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.899
to get drawn into a military conflict.

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:04.510
And so the right course for us is working
through our partners and with our own resources

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:10.950
to identify responsible parties within Syria,
organize them, bring them together in a — in

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:16.380
a form of — of — if not government, a
form of — of council that can take the lead

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:21.140
in Syria, and then make sure they have the
arms necessary to defend themselves. We do

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.180
need to make sure that they don’t have arms
that get into the — the wrong hands. Those

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.050
arms could be used to hurt us down the road.
We need to make sure as well that we coordinate

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.970
this effort with our allies and particularly
with — with — with Israel. But the Saudis

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.840
and the Qatari and — and — and the Turks
are all very concerned about this. They’re

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.310
willing to work with us. We need to have a
very effective leadership effort in Syria,

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.280
making sure that the — the — the insurgents
there are armed and that the insurgents that

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.990
become armed are people who will be the responsible
parties.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:57.540
Recognize I believe that Assad must go. I
believe he will go. But I believe we want

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.040
to make sure that we have the relationships
of friendship with the people that take his

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:08.200
place such that in the years to come we see
Syria as a — as a friend and Syria as a

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.910
responsible party in the Middle East. This
— this is a critical opportunity for America.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.190
And what I’m afraid of is that we’ve watched
over the past year or so first the president

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:20.320
saying, well, we’ll let the U.N. deal with
it, and Assad — excuse me, Kofi Annan came

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.350
in and — and said, we’re going to try
— have a cease-fire.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.900
That didn’t work. Then it looked to the
Russians and said, see if you can do something.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.600
we should. We should be playing the leadership
role there, not on the ground with military

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600
—

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600
MR. ROMNEY: — by the leadership role.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.230
PRESIDENT OBAMA: We are — we playing the
leadership role. We organized the “Friends

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:41.710
of Syria.” We are mobilizing humanitarian
support and support for the opposition. And

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.941
we are making sure that that those we help
are those who will be friends of ours in the

00:18:46.941 --> 00:18:50.260
long term and friends of our allies in the
region over the long term.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:55.530
But you know, going back to Libya, because
this is an example of — of how we make choices,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:01.830
you know, when we went into Libya and we were
able to immediately stop the massacre there

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.310
because of the unique circumstances and the
coalition that we had helped to organize,

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:11.650
we also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi
didn’t stay there. And to the governor’s

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:17.140
credit, you supported us going into Libya
and the coalition that we organized. But when

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:23.010
it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did
not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor,

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:30.260
your suggestion was that this was mission
creep, that this was mission muddle.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.220
Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.
That — Moammar Gadhafi had more American

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.330
blood on his hands than any individual other
than Osama bin Laden. And so we were going

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.270
to make sure that we finished the job. That’s
part of the reason why the Libyans stand with

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:51.410
us. But we did so in a careful, thoughtful
way, making certain that we knew who we were

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:57.310
dealing with, that those forces of moderation
on the ground were ones that we could work

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:02.440
with. And we have to take the same kind of
steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.040
to Syria. That’s exactly what we’re doing.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.880
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor, can I just ask you,
would you go beyond what the administration

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.780
would do? Like, for example, would you put
in no-fly zones over Syria?

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.950
MR. ROMNEY: I don’t — I don’t want to
have our military involved in — in Syria.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.910
I don’t think there’s a necessity to put
our military in Syria at — at this stage.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.420
I don’t anticipate that in the future.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.190
As I indicated, our objectives are to replace
Assad and to have in place a new government

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.320
which is friendly to us — a responsible
government, if possible. And I want to make

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.290
sure the get armed and they have the arms
necessary to defend themselves but also to

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.080
remove — to remove Assad. But I do not want
to see a military involvement on the part

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.430
of — of our — of our troops.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.260
And this isn’t — this isn’t going to
be necessary. We have — with our partners

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.850
in the region, we have sufficient resources
to support those groups. But look, this has

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:57.170
been going on for a year. This is a time — this
should have been a time for American leadership.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:01.430
We should have taken a leading role — not
militarily, but a leading role organizationally,

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.510
governmentally, to bring together the parties
there to find responsible parties.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:11.990
As you hear from intelligence sources even
today, the insurgents are highly disparate.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:16.330
They haven’t come together. They haven’t
formed a unity group, a council of some kind.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.840
That needs to happen. America can help that
happen. And we need to make sure they have

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.650
the arms they need to carry out the very important
role, which is getting rid of Assad.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.320
MR. SCHIEFFER: Could we get a quick response,
Mr. President, because I want to ask —

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.430
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I’ll — I’ll — I’ll
be — I’ll be very quick. What you just

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:36.010
heard Governor Romney said is he doesn’t
have different ideas, and that’s because

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:44.360
we’re doing exactly what we should be doing
to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.540
and a — an effective transition so that
we get Assad out. That’s the kind of leadership

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.640
we’ve shown. That’s the kind of leadership
we’ll continue to show.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.650
MR. SCHIEFFER: May I ask you, you know, during
the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.620
you said it was time for President Mubarak
to go.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.620
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Right.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.330
MR. SCHIEFFER: Some in your administration
thought perhaps we should have waited a while

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.970
on that. Do you have any regrets about that?

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.440
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, I don’t because I think
that America has to stand with democracy.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.720
The notion that we would have tanks run over
those young people who were in Tahrir Square,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.280
that is not the kind of American leadership
that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.320
ago.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.740
But what I’ve also said is that now that
you have a democratically elected government

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:36.830
in Egypt, that they have to make sure that
they take responsibility for protecting religious

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.462
minorities — and we have put significant
pressure on them to make sure they’re doing

00:22:40.462 --> 00:22:46.120
that — to recognize the rights of women,
which is critical throughout the region. These

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.490
countries can’t develop if young women are
not given the kind of education that they

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.490
need.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:56.920
They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.
That is a red line for us, because not only

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.930
is Israel’s security at stake, but our security
is at stake if that unravels.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.590
They have to make sure that they’re cooperating
with us when it comes to counterterrorism.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:10.860
And we will help them with respect to developing
their own economy, because ultimately, what’s

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.750
going to make the Egyptian revolution successful
for the people of Egypt but also for the world

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.120
is if those young people who gathered there
are seeing opportunities. Their aspirations

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.370
are similar to young people’s here. They
want jobs. They want to be able to make sure

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.480
their kids are going to a good school. They
want to make sure that they have a roof over

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.300
their heads and that they have a — the prospects
of a better life in the future.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.980
And so one of the things that we’ve been
doing is — is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:45.010
conferences with these Egyptians to — to
give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.400
their economy in a way that’s noncorrupt,
that’s transparent.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.120
But what is also important for us to understand
is — is that for America to be successful

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.650
in this region, there are some things that
we’re going to have to do here at home as

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:03.810
well. You know, one of the challenges over
the last decade is we’ve done experiments

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:09.090
in nation building in places like Iraq and
Afghanistan. And we’ve neglected, for example,

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:14.860
developing our own economy, our own energy
sectors, our own education system. And it’s

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.020
very hard for us to project leadership around
the world when we’re not doing what we need

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.020
to do here.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.750
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor Romney, I want to
hear your response to that, but I would just

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.840
ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.770
MR. ROMNEY: No, I believe, as the president
indicated and said at the time, that I supported

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:34.950
his — his action there. I felt that — I
wish we’d have had a better vision of the

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.800
future. I wish that, looking back at the beginning
of the president’s term and even further

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.390
back than that, that we’d have recognized
that there was a growing energy and passion

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.810
for freedom in that part of the world and
that we would have worked more aggressively

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.740
with our — our friend and with other friends
in the region to have them make the transition

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.190
towards a more representative form of government
such that it didn’t explode in the way it

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.640
did. But once it exploded, I felt the same
as the president did, which is these — these

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.660
freedom voices in the — the streets of Egypt
where the people who were speaking of our

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:09.740
principles and the — the — President Mubarak
had done things which were unimaginable, and

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.000
the idea of him crushing his people was not
something that we could possibly support.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.440
Let me — let me step back and talk about
what I think our mission has to be in the

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.510
Middle East, and even more broadly, because
our purpose is to make sure the world is more

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:26.480
— is peaceful. We want a peaceful planet.
We want people to be able to enjoy their lives

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.150
and know they’re going to have a bright
and prosperous future and not be at war. That’s

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.460
our purpose. And the mantle of — of leadership
for promoting the principles of peace has

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.770
fallen to America. We didn’t ask for it,
but it’s an honor that we have it.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:43.820
But for us to be able to promote those principles
of peace requires us to be strong, and that

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.500
begins with a strong economy here at home,
and unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.610
When the — when the — the president of
Iraq — excuse me — of Iran, Ahmadinejad,

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:58.400
says that our debt makes us not a great country,
that’s a frightening thing. The former chief

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.880
of — chief of the Joints Chief of Staff
said that — Admiral Mullen — said that

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.760
our debt is the biggest national security
threat we face. This — we have weakened

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.760
our economy.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.071
We need a strong economy. We need to have
as well a strong military. Our military is

00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:16.680
second to none in the world. We’re blessed
with terrific soldiers and extraordinary technology

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.030
and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion
dollars in cuts through sequestration and

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.130
budget cuts to the military would change that.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:27.990
We need to have strong allies. Our association
and — and connection with our allies is

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.470
essential to America’s strength. We’re
the — the great nation that has allies,

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.520
42 allies and friends around the world.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.720
And finally, we have to stand by our principles.
And if we’re strong in each of those things,

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.270
American influence will grow. But unfortunately,
in nowhere in the world is America’s influence

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.570
greater today than it was four years ago.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.570
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:48.570
MR. ROMNEY: And that’s because we’ve become
weaker on each of those four dimensions.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:49.570
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right — perfect. You’re
going to get a chance to respond to that because

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:55.220
that’s a perfect segue into our next segment,
and that is what is America’s role in the

00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:01.310
world. And that is the question. What do each
of you see as our role in the world?

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.180
And I believe, Governor Romney, it’s your
turn to go first.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:09.640
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I — I absolutely believe
that America has a — a responsibility and

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:14.850
the privilege of helping defend freedom and
promote the principles that — that make

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:24.670
the world more peaceful. And those principles
include human rights, human dignity, free

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:31.280
enterprise, freedom of expression, elections,
because when there are elections, people tend

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.890
to vote for peace. They don’t vote for war.
So we want to — to promote those principles

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.870
around the world. We recognize that there
are places of conflict in the world. We want

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.820
to end those conflicts to the extent humanly
possible. But in order to be able to fulfill

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.600
our role in the world, America must be strong.
America must lead.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.790
And for that to happen, we have to strengthen
our economy here at home. You can’t have

00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:00.610
23 million people struggling to get a job.
You — you can’t have an economy that over

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.850
the last three years keeps slowing down its
growth rate. You can’t have kids coming

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:09.850
out of college, half of whom can’t find
a job today, or a job that’s commensurate

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.860
with their college degree. We have to get
our economy going.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.390
And our military — we’ve got to strengthen
our military long- term. We don’t know what

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:22.001
the world is going to throw at us down the
road. We — we make decisions today in a

00:28:22.001 --> 00:28:25.780
military that — that will confront challenges
we can’t imagine.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.640
In the 2000 debates there was no mention of
terrorism, for instance. And a year later,

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.102
9/11 happened. So we have to make decisions
based upon uncertainty. And that means a strong

00:28:35.102 --> 00:28:37.680
military. I will not cut our military budget.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.101
We have to also stand by our allies. I think
the tension that existed between Israel and

00:28:43.101 --> 00:28:47.950
the United States was very unfortunate. I
think also that pulling our missile defense

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:54.970
program out of Poland in the way we was also
unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.700
the relationship in some ways that existed
between us.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.050
And then of course, with regards to standing
for our principles, when — when the students

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:07.200
took to the streets in Tehran and the people
there protested, the Green Revolution occurred.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.520
For the president to be silent I thought was
an enormous mistake. We have to stand for

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.400
our principles, stand for our allies, stand
for a strong military and stand for a stronger

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.400
economy.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.400
MR. SCHIEFFER: Mr. President.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.900
PRESIDENT OBAMA: America remains the one indispensable
nation. And the world needs a strong America.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:30.240
And it is stronger now then when I came into
office. Because we ended the war in Iraq,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:36.420
we were able to refocus our attention on not
only the terrorist threat but also beginning

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:42.650
a transition process in Afghanistan. It also
allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.570
that had been neglected for a decade.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:53.720
And, Governor Romney, our alliances have never
been stronger. In Asia, in Europe, in Africa,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:59.810
with Israel where we have unprecedented military
and intelligence cooperation, including dealing

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:05.790
with the Iranian threat. But what we also
have been able to do is position ourselves

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.350
so we can start rebuilding America.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:13.220
And that’s what my plan does: Making sure
that we’re bringing manufacturing back to

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.780
our shores so that we’re creating jobs here,
as we’ve done with the auto industry, not

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.290
rewarding companies that are shipping jobs
overseas; making sure that we’ve got the

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:27.360
best education system in the world, including
retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow;

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.420
doing everything we can to control our energy.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:35.080
We’ve cut our oil imports to the lowest
level in two decades because we’ve developed

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:41.230
oil and natural gas, but we also have to develop
clean energy technologies that will allow

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:47.520
us to cut our exports in half by 2020. That’s
the kind of leadership that we need to show.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.140
And we’ve got to make sure that we reduce
our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romney’s

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.280
plan doesn’t do it. We’ve got to do it
in a responsible way, by cutting out spending

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.081
we don’t need but also asking the wealthiest
to pay a little bit more. That way we can

00:31:00.081 --> 00:31:04.990
invest in the research and technology that’s
always kept us at the cutting edge.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:11.410
Now Governor Romney has taken a different
approach throughout this campaign. You know,

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.820
both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong
and reckless policies. He’s praised George

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.590
Bush as good economic steward and Dick Cheney
as somebody who shows great wisdom and judgment.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:22.580
And taking us back to those kinds of strategies
that got us into this mess are not the way

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.270
that we are going to maintain leadership in
the 21st century.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.790
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor Romney, wrong and
reckless policies?

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.790
MR. ROMNEY: (Chuckles.) I’ve got a policy
for the future and agenda for the future.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.900
And when it comes to our economy here at home,
I know what it takes to create 12 million

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.340
new jobs and rising take- home pay. And what
we’ve seen over the last four years is something

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.100
I don’t want to see over the next four years.
The — the president said by now we’d be

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:45.460
at 5.4 percent unemployment. We’re 9 million
jobs short of that. I will get America working

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:50.450
again and see rising take- home pay again.
And I’ll do it with five simple steps.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:32:04.340
Number one, were going to have North American
energy independence. We’re going to do it

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.190
by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas,
nuclear and our renewables.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.560
Number two, we’re going to increase our
trade. Trade grows about 12 percent per year.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.350
It doubles about every — every five or — or
so years. We can do better than that, particularly

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.910
in Latin America. The opportunities for us
in Latin America we have just not taken advantage

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:23.910
of fully.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.420
As a matter of fact, Latin America’s economy
is almost as big as the economy of China.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:34.400
We’re all focused on China. Latin America
is a huge opportunity for us: time zone, language

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400
opportunities.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.960
Number three, we’re going to have to have
training programs that work for our workers

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.570
and schools that finally put the parents and
the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.430
union’s going to have to go behind.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:51.150
And then we’re going to have to get to a
balanced budget. We can’t expect entrepreneurs

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.720
and businesses large and small to take their
life savings or their companies’ money and

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.620
invest in America if they think we’re headed
to the road to Greece. And that’s where

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.050
we’re going right now unless we finally
get off this spending and borrowing binge.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:06.510
And I’ll get us on track to a balanced budget.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:12.132
And finally, number five, we’ve got to champion
small business. Small business is where — where

00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:17.620
jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come
from small businesses. New business formation

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:22.480
is down to the lowest level in 30 years under
this administration. I want to bring it back

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.930
and get back good jobs and rising take-home
pay.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.450
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, let’s talk about
what we need to compete. First of all, Governor

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:35.450
Romney talks about small businesses, but Governor,
when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses’

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:39.400
development ranked about 48, I think, out
of 50 states, in Massachusetts, because the

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.780
policies that you’re promoting actually
don’t help small businesses. And the way

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:48.400
you define small businesses include folks
at the very top. They include you and me.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.470
That’s not the kind of small business promotion
we need.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.900
But — but let’s take an example that we
know is going to make a difference 21st century,

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.021
and that’s our education policy. We didn’t
have a lot of chance to talk about this in

00:33:58.021 --> 00:34:04.130
the last debate. You know, under my leadership,
what we’ve done is reformed education, working

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:11.139
with governors, 46 states. We’ve seen progress
and gains in schools that were having a terrible

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:15.950
time, and they’re starting to finally make
progress. And what I now want to do is to

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:20.200
hire more teachers, especially in math and
science, because we know that we’ve fallen

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.259
behind when it comes to math and science.
And those teachers can make a difference.

00:34:24.259 --> 00:34:29.629
Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked
by teachers whether or not this would help

00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:33.659
the economy grow, you said, this isn’t going
to help the economy grow. When you were asked

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.659
about reduced class sizes, you said class
sizes don’t make a difference. But I tell

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:38.419
you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell
you it does make a difference.

00:34:38.419 --> 00:34:43.799
And if we’ve got math teachers who are able
to provide the kind of support that they need

00:34:43.799 --> 00:34:48.700
for our kids, that’s what’s going to determine
whether or not the new businesses are created

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.520
here. Companies are going to locate here depending
on whether we’ve got the most highly skilled

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.559
workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals
that you’ve put forward — when we don’t

00:34:55.559 --> 00:34:58.470
ask either you or me to pay a dime more in
terms of reducing the deficit, but instead

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:04.289
we slash support for education, that’s undermining
our long-term competitiveness. That is not

00:35:04.289 --> 00:35:07.119
good for America’s position in the world.
And the world notices.

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:09.520
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let me get back to foreign
policy.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.520
MR. ROMNEY: Well —

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.520
MR. SCHIEFFER: Can I just get back —

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.290
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I need to speak a moment
if you’ll let me, Bob —

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.290
MR. SCHIEFFER: OK.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:17.009
MR. ROMNEY: — just about education, because
I’m — I’m so proud of the state that

00:35:17.009 --> 00:35:23.099
I had the chance to be governor of. We have,
every two years, tests that look at how well

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:33.190
our kids are doing. Fourth graders and eighth
graders are tested 

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:37.049
in English and math. While I was governor,
I was proud that our fourth graders came out

00:35:37.049 --> 00:35:41.009
number one of all 50 states in English and
then also in math, and our eighth graders

00:35:41.009 --> 00:35:45.410
number one in English and also in math — first
time one state had been number one in all

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.180
four measures. How did we do that?

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:55.500
Well, Republicans and Democrats came together
on a bipartisan basis to put in place education

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.619
that focused on having great teachers in the
classroom. And that was —

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:00.619
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Ten years earlier —

00:36:00.619 --> 00:36:03.230
MR. ROMNEY: That was — that was what allowed
us to become the number one state in the nation.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.230
And this is — and we were —

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.450
PRESIDENT OBAMA: But that was 10 years before
you took office.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.450
MR. ROMNEY: And we — absolutely.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.450
MR. SCHIEFFER: Gentlemen —

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:08.500
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And then you cut education
spending when you came into office.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.250
MR. ROMNEY: The first — the first — and
we kept our schools number one in the nation.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.930
They’re still number one today. And the
principles that we’ve put in place — we

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:18.259
also gave kids not just a graduation exam
that — that determined whether they were

00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:22.461
up to the skills needed to — to be able
to compete, but also, if they graduated in

00:36:22.461 --> 00:36:27.869
the top quarter of their class, they got a
four-year tuition-free ride at any Massachusetts

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:29.410
public institution of higher learning.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:30.619
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That happened — that happened
before you came into office.

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:31.619
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor —

00:36:31.619 --> 00:36:33.509
MR. ROMNEY: That was actually mine, actually,
Mr. President. You got that fact wrong.

00:36:33.509 --> 00:36:37.289
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let me — I want to try to
shift it, because we have heard some of this

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:41.660
in the other debates. Governor, you say you
want a bigger military. You want a bigger

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:48.509
Navy. You don’t want to cut defense spending.
What I want to ask you, we’re talking about

00:36:48.509 --> 00:36:52.279
financial problems in this country. Where
are you going to get the money?

00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:54.961
MR. ROMNEY: Well, let’s — let’s come
back and talk about the military, but all

00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:57.769
the way — all the way through. First of
all, I’m going through, from the very beginning,

00:36:57.769 --> 00:37:03.119
we’re going to cut about 5 percent of the
discretionary budget excluding military. That’s

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:04.119
number one. All right?

00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:06.839
MR. SCHIEFFER: But can you do this without
driving us deeper into debt?

00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:10.190
MR. ROMNEY: The good news is, I’ll be happy
to have you take a look. Come on our website,

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:14.589
you’ll look at how we get to a balanced
budget within eight to 10 years. We do it

00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:18.309
by getting — by reducing spending in a whole
series of programs. By the way, number one

00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:23.410
I get rid of is “Obamacare.” There are
a number of things that sound good but, frankly,

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:27.310
we just can’t afford them. And that one
doesn’t sound good, and it’s not affordable,

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.110
so I get rid of that one from day one; to
the extent humanly possible, we get that out.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:36.160
We take program after program that we don’t
absolutely have to have and we get rid of

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.160
them.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.800
Number two, we take some programs that we
are going to keep, like Medicaid, which is

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.569
a program for the poor. We’re — take that
health care program for the poor, and we give

00:37:45.569 --> 00:37:50.590
it to the states to run because states run
these programs more efficiently. As a governor,

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.080
I thought, please, give me this program.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.080
MR. SCHIEFFER: Can he do that?

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.080
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible.)

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.750
MR. ROMNEY: I can run this more efficiently
than the federal government. And states, by

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:02.470
the way, are proving it. States like Arizona,
Rhode Island have taken these Medicaid dollars,

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.500
have shown they can run these programs more
cost effectively.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Bob —

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.470
MR. ROMNEY: So I want to do those two things
that gets us — it gets us to a balanced

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.730
budget with eight in — eight to 10 years.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Bob —

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.730
MR. ROMNEY: But the military —

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:13.730
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let —

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:14.730
MR. ROMNEY: Let’s go back to the military,
though.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:15.990
MR. SCHIEFFER: Well, that’s what I’m trying
to find out about.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.109
MR. ROMNEY: Let’s talk about the military.

00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:20.589
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You should have answered
the first question.

00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:26.599
Look, Governor Romney’s called for $5 trillion
of tax cuts that he says he’s going to pay

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:28.940
for by closing deductions.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:33.970
Now, the math doesn’t work but he continues
to claim that he’s going to do it. He then

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:38.910
wants to spend another $2 trillion on military
spending that our military’s not asking

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:40.000
for.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.220
Now, keep in mind that our military spending
has gone up every single year that I’ve

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.210
been in office. We spend more on our military
than the next 10 countries combined — China,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:59.079
Russia, France, the United — United Kingdom,
you name it, next 10. And what I did was work

00:38:59.079 --> 00:39:04.290
with our Joint Chiefs of Staff to think about
what are we going to need in the future to

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.940
make sure that we are safe? And that’s the
budget that we’ve put forward.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:15.410
But what you can’t do is spend $2 trillion
in additional military spending that the military

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:22.569
is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts,
you say that you’re going to pay for it

00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:27.049
by closing loopholes and deductions without
naming what those loopholes and deductions

00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:31.990
are, and then somehow you’re also going
to deal with the deficit that we’ve already

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.980
got. The math simply doesn’t work.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.710
But when it comes to our military, what we
have to think about is not, you know, just

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.140
budgets, we got to think about capabilities.
We need to be thinking about cybersecurity.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:49.609
We need to be thinking about space. That’s
exactly what our budget does, but it’s driven

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:54.839
by strategy. It’s not driven by politics.
It’s not driven by members of Congress and

00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:59.920
what they would like to see. It’s driven
by what are we going to need to keep the American

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.920
people safe?

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:06.440
That’s exactly what our budget does. And
it also then allows us to reduce our deficit,

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:12.650
which is a significant national security concern
because we’ve got to make sure that our

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:16.240
economy is strong at home so that we can project
military power overseas.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.769
MR. ROMNEY: Bob, I’m pleased that I’ve
balanced budgets. I was in the world of business

00:40:20.769 --> 00:40:21.769
for 25 years.

00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:22.769
If you didn’t balance your budget, you went
out of business. I went to the Olympics that

00:40:22.769 --> 00:40:26.390
was out of balance, and we got it on balance
and made a success there. I had the chance

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:31.080
to be governor of a state. Four years in a
row, Democrats and Republicans came together

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.499
to balance the budget. We cut taxes 19 times,
balanced our budget. The president hasn’t

00:40:36.499 --> 00:40:39.569
balanced a budget yet. I expect to have the
opportunity to do so myself.

00:40:39.569 --> 00:40:40.569
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right.

00:40:40.569 --> 00:40:42.999
MR. ROMNEY: I — I’m going to be able to
balance the budget. Let’s talk about military

00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:45.020
spending, and that’s this. Our Navy —

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.020
MR. SCHIEFFER: About 30 seconds.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.259
MR. ROMNEY: Our Navy is older — excuse me
— our Navy is smaller now than any time

00:40:49.259 --> 00:40:58.710
since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313
ships to carry out their mission. We’re

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:03.059
now down to 285. We’re headed down to the
— to the low 200s if we go through with

00:41:03.059 --> 00:41:06.690
sequestration. That’s unacceptable to me.
I want to make sure that we have the ships

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.190
that are required by our Navy.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:14.059
Our Air Force is older and smaller than any
time since it was founded in 1947. We’ve

00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:18.640
changed for the first time since FDR. We — since
FDR we had the — we’ve always had the

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.839
strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts
at once. Now we’re changing to one conflict.

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:28.960
Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility
of the president of the United States, which

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.359
is to maintain the safety of the American
people. And I will not cut our military budget

00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:38.869
by a trillion dollars, which is the combination
of the budget cuts that the president has

00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:43.839
as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in
my view, is — is — is making our future

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:45.520
less certain and less secure. I won’t do
it.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.560
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Bob, I just need to comment
on this. First of all, the sequester is not

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.609
something that I proposed. It’s something
that Congress has proposed. It will not happen.

00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:57.869
The budget that we’re talking about is not
reducing our military spending. It’s maintaining

00:41:57.869 --> 00:41:58.869
it.

00:41:58.869 --> 00:42:03.839
But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn’t
spent enough time looking at how our military

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:07.210
works. You — you mentioned the Navy, for
example, and that we have fewer ships than

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:12.980
we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have
fewer horses and bayonets — (laughter) — because

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.559
the nature of our military’s changed. We
have these things called aircraft carriers

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:22.079
where planes land on them. We have these ships
that go underwater, nuclear submarines.

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:27.920
And so the question is not a game of Battleship
where we’re counting ships. It’s — it’s

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.009
what are our capabilities.

00:42:29.009 --> 00:42:34.220
And so when I sit down with the secretary
of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:40.170
we determine how are we going to be best able
to meet all of our defense needs in a way

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:45.319
that also keeps faith with our troops, that
also makes sure that our veterans have the

00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:50.411
kind of support that they need when they come
home. And that is not reflected in the kind

00:42:50.411 --> 00:42:53.249
of budget that you’re putting forward, because
it just don’t work.

00:42:53.249 --> 00:42:54.249
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right.

00:42:54.249 --> 00:42:57.849
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And you know, we’ve visited
the website quite a bit. And it still doesn’t

00:42:57.849 --> 00:42:58.849
work.

00:42:58.849 --> 00:43:01.650
MR. SCHIEFFER: A lot to cover. I’d like
— (murmurs) — I’d like to move to the

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:09.740
next segment: red lines, Israel and Iran.
Would either of you — and you’ll have

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.509
two minutes, and President Obama, you have
the first go at this one. Would either of

00:43:14.509 --> 00:43:21.960
you be willing to declare that an attack on
Israel is an attack on the United States,

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:27.339
which of course is the same promise that we
give to our close allies like Japan? And if

00:43:27.339 --> 00:43:34.839
you made such a declaration, would not that
deter Iran? It’s certainly deterred the

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:40.180
Soviet Union for a long, long time when we
made that — when we made that promise to

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.180
our allies.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.180
Mr. President.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.849
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, Israel
is a true friend. It is our greatest ally

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:51.869
in the region. And if Israel is attacked,
America will stand with Israel. I’ve made

00:43:51.869 --> 00:43:53.430
that clear throughout my presidency. And —

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.369
MR. SCHIEFFER: So you’re saying we’ve
already made that declaration?

00:43:56.369 --> 00:44:00.569
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I will stand with Israel
if they are attacked. And this is the reason

00:44:00.569 --> 00:44:02.900
why, working with Israel, we have created
the strongest military and intelligence cooperation

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.460
between our two countries in history. In fact,
this week we’ll be carrying out the largest

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:12.269
military exercise with Israel in history,
this very week.

00:44:12.269 --> 00:44:18.930
But to the issue of Iran, as long as I’m
president of the United States, Iran will

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:20.630
not get a nuclear weapon.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:27.359
I’ve made that clear when I came into office.
We then organized the strongest coalition

00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:32.200
and the strongest sanctions against Iran in
history, and it is crippling their economy.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.589
Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their
oil production has plunged to the lowest level

00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:42.690
since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20
years ago. So their economy is in a shambles.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:49.210
And the reason we did this is because a nuclear
Iran is a threat to our national security

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:54.900
and it’s threat to Israel’s national security.
We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:59.790
in the most volatile region of the world.
Iran’s a state sponsor of terrorism, and

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:05.480
for them to be able to provide nuclear technology
to nonstate actors — that’s unacceptable.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.119
And they have said that they want to see Israel
wiped off the map.

00:45:10.119 --> 00:45:17.030
So the work that we’ve done with respect
to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:25.740
can take the diplomatic route and end their
nuclear program or they will have to face

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:31.259
a united world and a United States president,
me, who said we’re not going to take any

00:45:31.259 --> 00:45:32.890
options off the table.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:37.290
The disagreement I have with Governor Romney
is that during the course of this campaign

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:42.990
he’s often talked as if we should take premature
military action. I think that would be a mistake

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.830
because when I’ve sent young men and women
into harm’s way, I always understand that

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:51.010
that is the last rest, not the first resort.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:52.450
MR. SCHIEFFER: Two minutes.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:57.910
MR. ROMNEY: Well, first of all, I — I want
to underscore the — the same point the president

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:01.710
made, which is that if I’m president of
the United States, when I’m president of

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:06.289
the United States, we will stand with Israel.
And — and if Israel is attacked, we have

00:46:06.289 --> 00:46:11.480
their back, not just diplomatically, not just
culturally, but militarily. That’s number

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.480
one.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.289
Number two, with regards to — to Iran and
the threat of Iran, there’s no question

00:46:16.289 --> 00:46:21.070
but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable
Iran, is unacceptable to America.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:25.309
It presents a threat not only to our friends,
but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran

00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:29.359
have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that
could be used against us or used to be threatening

00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:30.359
to us.

00:46:30.359 --> 00:46:33.980
It’s also essential for us to understand
what our mission is in Iran, and that is to

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:39.420
dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon
through peaceful and diplomatic means. And

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.630
crippling sanctions are something I’d called
for five years ago when I was in Israel speaking

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.980
at the Herzliya Conference. I laid out seven
steps.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.230
Crippling sanctions were number one. And they
do work. You’re seeing it right now in the

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.680
economy. It’s absolutely the right thing
to do to have crippling sanctions. I’d have

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.720
put them in place earlier, but it’s good
that we have them.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:03.190
Number two, something I would add today is
I would tighten those sanctions. I would say

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:07.980
that ships that carry Iranian oil can’t
come into our ports. I imagine the EU would

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.859
agree with us as well. Not only ships couldn’t,
I’d say companies that are moving their

00:47:11.859 --> 00:47:15.359
oil can’t, people who are trading in their
oil can’t. I would tighten those sanctions

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.359
further.

00:47:16.359 --> 00:47:21.759
Secondly, I’d take on diplomatic isolation
efforts. I’d make sure that Ahmadinejad

00:47:21.759 --> 00:47:27.039
is indicted under the Genocide Convention.
His words amount to genocide incitation. I

00:47:27.039 --> 00:47:30.950
would indict him for it. I would also make
sure that their diplomats are treated like

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:36.309
the pariah they are around the world, the
same way we treated the apartheid diplomats

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:37.599
of South Africa.

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:43.039
We need to increase pressure time and time
again on Iran because anything other than

00:47:43.039 --> 00:47:48.319
a — a — a solution to this which says
— which stops this nuclear folly of theirs

00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:54.550
is unacceptable to America. And of course,
a military action is the last resort. It is

00:47:54.550 --> 00:48:00.650
something one would only, only consider if
all of the other avenues had been — had

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:02.450
been tried to their full extent.

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:07.190
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let me ask both of you, there
— as you know, there are reports that Iran

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:12.730
and the United States, as part of an international
group, have agreed in principle to talks about

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:19.309
Iran’s nuclear program. What is the deal
if there are such talks? What is the deal

00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:21.119
that you would accept? Mr. President.

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:26.140
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, those
were reports in the newspaper. They are not

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:35.280
true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize
it needs to give up its nuclear program and

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.549
abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been
in place, because they have the opportunity

00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:46.200
to re-enter the community of nations, and
we would welcome that. There are — there

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:50.369
are people in Iran who have the same aspirations
as people all around the world, for a better

00:48:50.369 --> 00:48:57.829
life. And we hope that their leadership takes
the right decision. But the deal we’ll accept

00:48:57.829 --> 00:49:01.170
is, they end their nuclear program. It’s
very straightforward.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:05.400
And you know, I’m glad that Governor Romney
agrees with the steps that we’re taking.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.280
You know, there have been times, Governor,
frankly, during the course of this campaign,

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.569
where it sounded like you thought that you’d
do the some things we did, but you’d say

00:49:15.569 --> 00:49:20.539
them louder and somehow that that would make
a difference, and it turns out that the work

00:49:20.539 --> 00:49:26.599
involved in setting up these crippling sanctions
is painstaking; it’s meticulous. We started

00:49:26.599 --> 00:49:28.609
from the day we got into office.

00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:32.869
And the reason it was so important — and
this is a testament to how we’ve restored

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:37.289
American credibility and strength around the
world — is we had to make sure that all

00:49:37.289 --> 00:49:42.839
the countries participated, even countries
like Russia and China, because if it’s just

00:49:42.839 --> 00:49:47.190
us that are imposing sanctions, we’ve had
sanctions in place for a long time. It’s

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:53.609
because we got everybody to agree that Iran
is seeing so much pressure. And we’ve got

00:49:53.609 --> 00:49:54.670
to maintain that pressure.

00:49:54.670 --> 00:50:00.680
There is a deal to be had, and that is that
they abide by the rules that have already

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:05.059
been established; they convince the international
community they are not pursuing a nuclear

00:50:05.059 --> 00:50:11.700
program; there are inspections that are very
intrusive. But over time, what they can do

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:16.999
is regain credibility. In the meantime, though,
we’re not going to let up the pressure until

00:50:16.999 --> 00:50:19.269
we have clear evidence that that takes place.

00:50:19.269 --> 00:50:24.130
And one last thing. I’m — just to make
this point: The clock is ticking.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:31.510
We’re not going to allow Iran to perpetually
engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:36.269
And I’ve been very clear to them, you know,
because of the intelligence coordination that

00:50:36.269 --> 00:50:40.480
we do with a range of countries, including
Israel, we have a sense of when they would

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:45.519
get breakout capacity, which means that we
would not be able to intervene in time to

00:50:45.519 --> 00:50:47.740
stop their nuclear program, and that clock
is ticking.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.740
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right.

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.569
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And we’re going to make
sure that if they do not meet the demands

00:50:52.569 --> 00:50:57.570
of the international community, then we are
going to take all options necessary to make

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:58.819
sure they don’t have a nuclear weapon.

00:50:58.819 --> 00:50:59.819
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor.

00:50:59.819 --> 00:51:03.420
MR. ROMNEY: I think from the very beginning,
one of the challenges we’ve had with Iran

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.960
is that they have looked at this administration
and — and felt that the administration was

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.549
not as strong as it needed to be. I think
they saw weakness where they had expected

00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:13.410
to find American strength.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.839
And I say that because from the very beginning,
the president, in his campaign some four years

00:51:16.839 --> 00:51:20.779
ago, said he’d meet with all the world’s
worst actors in his first year. He’d — he’d

00:51:20.779 --> 00:51:27.269
sit down with Chavez and — and Kim Jong-Il,
with Castro and with — with President Ahmadinejad

00:51:27.269 --> 00:51:33.220
of — of Iran. And — and I think they looked
and thought, well, that’s an unusual honor

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.329
to receive from the president of the United
States.

00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:40.160
And then the president began what I’ve called
an apology tour of going to — to various

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.819
nations in the Middle East and — and criticizing
America. I think they looked at that and saw

00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:49.809
weakness. Then when there were dissidents
in the streets of Tehran, the Green Revolution,

00:51:49.809 --> 00:51:53.910
holding signs saying, is America with us,
the president was silent. I think they noticed

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:58.339
that as well. And I think that when the president
said he was going to create daylight between

00:51:58.339 --> 00:52:02.619
ourselves and Israel that — that they noticed
that as well.

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:07.150
All of these things suggested, I think, to
the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:11.440
can keep on pushing along here; we can keep
talks going on, but we’re just going to

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:17.039
keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are
some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium,

00:52:17.039 --> 00:52:21.200
preparing to — to create a — a — a — - a
nuclear threat to the United States and to

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.200
the world.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.450
That’s unacceptable for us, and — and
— and it’s essential for a president to

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:30.700
show strength from the very beginning to make
it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:37.299
And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable
to us. They must not develop nuclear capability.

00:52:37.299 --> 00:52:41.809
And the way to make sure they understand that
is by having from the very beginning the tightest

00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:47.079
sanctions possible. They need to be tightened.
Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.

00:52:47.079 --> 00:52:52.099
We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to
put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly

00:52:52.099 --> 00:52:55.690
can, because if we do that, we won’t have
to take the military action.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:53:01.359
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Bob, let me just respond.
Nothing Governor Romney just said is true,

00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:06.320
starting with this notion of me apologizing.
This has been probably the biggest whopper

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.950
that’s been told during the course of this
campaign, and every fact-checker and every

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:15.210
reporter’s looked at it. The governor has
said this is not true.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:21.359
And when it comes to tightening sanctions,
look, as I said before, we’ve put in the

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:27.150
toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And
the fact is while we were coordinating an

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:32.339
international coalition to make sure these
sanctions were effective, you were still invested

00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:37.849
in a Chinese state oil company that was doing
business with the Iranian oil sector. So I’ll

00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:42.839
let the American people decide, judge who’s
going to be more effective and more credible

00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:46.700
when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:52.069
And with respect to our attitude about the
Iranian revolution, I was very clear about

00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:57.130
the murderous activities that had taken place,
and that was contrary to international law

00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:04.920
and everything that civilized people stand
for. And — and so the strength that we have

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.123
shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we’ve
been able to mobilize the world. When I came

00:54:09.123 --> 00:54:21.500
into office, the world was divided. Iran was
resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point economically,

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:28.380
strategically, militarily than since — than
in many years.

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:40.390
MR. ROMNEY: We’re four years closer to a
nuclear Iran. We’re four years closer to

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:44.680
a nuclear Iran. And — and we should not
have wasted these four years to the extent

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.520
they’ve — they continue to be able to
spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.520
That’s number one.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:54.299
Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call
it an apology tour is because you went to

00:54:54.299 --> 00:54:59.329
the Middle East and you flew to — to Egypt
and to Saudi Arabia and to — to Turkey and

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:05.109
Iraq. And — and by way, you skipped Israel,
our closest friend in the region, but you

00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:09.799
went to the other nations. And by the way,
they noticed that you skipped Israel. And

00:55:09.799 --> 00:55:14.089
then in those nations and on Arabic TV you
said that America had been dismissive and

00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:20.390
derisive. You said that on occasion America
had dictated to other nations. Mr. President,

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:24.910
America has not dictated to other nations.
We have freed other nations from dictators.

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:29.809
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Bob, let me — let me respond.
You know, if we’re going to talk about trips

00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:36.339
that we’ve taken, you know, when I was a
candidate for office, first trip I took was

00:55:36.339 --> 00:55:39.210
to visit our troops.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:45.900
And when I went to Israel as a candidate,
I didn’t take donors, I didn’t attend

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:52.849
fundraisers, I went to Yad Vashem, the — the
Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:59.039
— the nature of evil and why our bond with
Israel will be unbreakable.

00:55:59.039 --> 00:56:04.569
And then I went down to the border towns of
Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining

00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:11.569
down from Hamas. And I saw families there
who showed me where missiles had come down

00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:15.690
near their children’s bedrooms, and I was
reminded of — of what that would mean if

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:22.300
those were my kids, which is why, as president,
we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.559
missiles.

00:56:23.559 --> 00:56:29.450
So that’s how I’ve used my travels when
I travel to Israel and when I travel to the

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:30.940
region.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:38.950
And the central question at this point is
going to be, who’s going to be credible

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:41.430
to all parties involved?

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:45.450
And they can look at my track record — whether
it’s Iran sanctions, whether it’s dealing

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:50.269
with counterterrorism, whether it’s supporting
democracy, whether it’s supporting women’s

00:56:50.269 --> 00:56:54.869
rights, whether it’s supporting religious
minorities — and they can say that the president

00:56:54.869 --> 00:56:59.160
of the United States and the United States
of America has stood on the right side of

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:05.180
history. And — and that kind of credibility
is precisely why we’ve been able to show

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:09.069
leadership on a wide range of issues facing
the world right now.

00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:15.220
MR. SCHIEFFER: What if — what if the prime
minister of Israel called you on the phone

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:20.999
and said: Our bombers are on the way. We’re
going to bomb Iran. What do you say?

00:57:20.999 --> 00:57:26.479
MR. ROMNEY: Bob, let’s not go into hypotheticals
of that nature. Our relationship with Israel,

00:57:26.479 --> 00:57:30.170
my relationship with the prime minister of
Israel is such that we would not get a call

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:34.830
saying our bombers are on the way or their
fighters are on the way. This is the kind

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:39.480
of thing that would have been discussed and
thoroughly evaluated well before that kind

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.480
of action.

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.480
MR. SCHIEFFER: So you’re saying just what
—

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.480
MR. ROMNEY: I’m — that’s — that’s
—

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.480
MR. SCHIEFFER: OK. But let’s see what — (inaudible)
—

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.043
MR. ROMNEY: Yes, but let me — let me — let
me come back — let’s come back — let’s

00:57:45.043 --> 00:57:47.900
come back and go back to what the president
was speaking about, which is what’s happening

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:52.900
in the world and — and — and the president’s
statement that things are going so well.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.790
Look, I — I look at what’s happening around
the world and I see Iran four years closer

00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:04.460
to a bomb. I see the Middle East with a rising
tide of violence, chaos, tumult. I see jihadists

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:09.420
continuing to spread. Whether they’re rising
or just about the same level hard to — hard

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:14.039
to precisely measure, but it’s clear they’re
there. They’re very, very strong.

00:58:14.039 --> 00:58:20.339
I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad
still in power. I see our trade deficit with

00:58:20.339 --> 00:58:25.579
China larger than it’s — growing larger
every year as a matter of fact. I look around

00:58:25.579 --> 00:58:30.619
the world and I don’t feel that — you
see North Korea continuing to export their

00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:31.619
nuclear technology.

00:58:31.619 --> 00:58:35.609
Russia’s said they’re not going to follow
Nunn-Lugar anymore; they’re (back ?) away

00:58:35.609 --> 00:58:40.750
from their nuclear proliferation treaty that
we had with them. I look around the world,

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:45.270
I don’t see our influence growing around
the world. I see our influence receding, in

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:49.890
part because of the failure of the president
to deal with our economic challenges at home,

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:53.239
in part because of our withdrawal from our
commitment to our military and the way I think

00:58:53.239 --> 00:59:00.060
it ought to be, in part because of the — the
— the turmoil with Israel. I mean, the president

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:05.619
received a letter from 38 Democrat senators
saying the tensions with Israel were a real

00:59:05.619 --> 00:59:06.619
problem.

00:59:06.619 --> 00:59:07.619
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No.

00:59:07.619 --> 00:59:10.690
MR. ROMNEY: They asked him, please repair
the tension — Democrat senators — please

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:13.770
repair the damage in his — in his own party.

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:15.049
MR. SCHIEFFER (?): All right.

00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:20.670
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor, the problem is,
is that on a whole range of issues, whether

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:28.490
it’s the Middle East, whether it’s Afghanistan,
whether it’s Iraq, whether it’s now Iran,

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:35.559
you’ve been all over the map. I mean, I’m
pleased that you now are endorsing our policy

00:59:35.559 --> 00:59:42.070
of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially
having bilateral discussions with the Iranians

00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:47.140
to end their nuclear program. But just a few
years ago you said that’s something you’d

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:53.549
never do, in the same way that you initially
opposed a time table in Afghanistan, now you’re

00:59:53.549 --> 01:00:00.279
for it, although it depends; in the same way
that you say you would have ended the war

01:00:00.279 --> 01:00:06.599
in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying
that we should have 20,000 more folks in there;

01:00:06.599 --> 01:00:14.210
the same way that you said that it was mission
creep to go after Gadhafi.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:18.690
When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden,
you said, well, any president would make that

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:24.799
call. But when you were a candidate in 2008
— as I was — and I said, if I got bin

01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:30.529
Laden in our sights, I would take that shot,
you said we shouldn’t move heaven and earth

01:00:30.529 --> 01:00:34.329
to get one man, and you said we should ask
Pakistan for permission.

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:38.960
And if we had asked Pakistan for permission,
we would not have gotten him. And it was worth

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.890
moving heaven and earth to get him.

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:46.660
You know, after we killed bin Laden, I was
at Ground Zero for a memorial and talked to

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:52.029
a — a — a young woman who was 4 years
old when 9/11 happened.

01:00:52.029 --> 01:00:58.779
And the last conversation she had with her
father was him calling from the twin towers,

01:00:58.779 --> 01:01:05.440
saying, Peyton (sp), I love you, and I will
always watch over you. And for the next decade

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.960
she was haunted by that conversation. And
she said to me, you know, by finally getting

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.690
bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:22.200
And when we do things like that, when we bring
those who have harmed us to justice, that

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.970
sends a message to the world, and it tells
Peyton (sp) that we did not forget her father.

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:24.970
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.309
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And — and I make that point
because that’s the kind of clarity of leadership

01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:33.559
— and those decisions are not always popular.
Those decisions generally are not poll-tested.

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:38.210
And even some in my own party, including my
current vice president, had the same critique

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:43.430
as you did. But what the American people understand
is, is that I look at what we need to get

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:47.960
done to keep the American people safe and
to move our interests forward, and I make

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.960
those decisions.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.979
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right. Let’s go — and
that leads us — this takes us right to the

01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:56.750
next segment, Governor, America’s longest
war, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.039
MR. ROMNEY: Bob —

01:01:58.039 --> 01:01:59.039
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor, you get to go first.

01:01:59.039 --> 01:02:01.289
MR. ROMNEY: You can’t — you can’t — well,
OK, but you can’t have the president just

01:02:01.289 --> 01:02:04.339
lay out a whole series of items without giving
me a chance to respond.

01:02:04.339 --> 01:02:07.319
MR. SCHIEFFER: With respect, sir, you had
laid out quite a program there.

01:02:07.319 --> 01:02:08.890
MR. ROMNEY: Well, that’s probably true.
(Chuckles.)

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.119
MR. SCHIEFFER: And we’ll — we’ll give
you —

01:02:10.119 --> 01:02:11.119
PRESIDENT OBAMA: We’ll agree (with that
?).

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:12.450
MR. SCHIEFFER: We’ll catch you up.

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:17.509
The United States is scheduled to turn over
responsibility for security in Afghanistan

01:02:17.509 --> 01:02:20.220
to the Afghans.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:25.109
At that point we will withdraw our combat
troops, leave a smaller force of Americans,

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:30.670
if I understand our policy, in Afghanistan
for training purposes. It seems to me the

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:39.599
key question here is what do you do if the
deadline arrives and it is obvious the Afghans

01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:45.039
are unable to handle their security? Do we
still leave? And I believe Governor Romney,

01:02:45.039 --> 01:02:46.039
it — you go first.

01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:51.170
MR. ROMNEY: Well, we’re going to be finished
by 2014. And when I’m president, we’ll

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:56.539
make sure we bring our troops out by the end
of 2014. The commanders and the generals there

01:02:56.539 --> 01:03:01.719
are on track to do so. We’ve seen progress
over the past several years. The surge has

01:03:01.719 --> 01:03:07.829
been successful, and the training program
is proceeding at pace. There are now a large

01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:13.710
number of Afghan security forces, 350,000,
that are — are ready to step in to provide

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:16.400
security. And — and we’re going to be
able to make that transition by the end of

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.599
— of 2014. So our troops’ll come home
at that point.

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:21.520
I — I can tell you, at the same time, that
— that we will make sure that we — we

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.259
look at what’s happening in Pakistan and
recognize that what’s happening in Pakistan

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:30.950
is going to have a major impact on the success
in Afghanistan. And — and I say that because

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:34.789
I know a lot of people just feel like we should
just brush our hands and walk away. And I

01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:39.489
don’t mean you, Mr. President, but some
people in the — in our nation feel that

01:03:39.489 --> 01:03:42.549
Pakistan (doesn’t ?) — being nice to us
and that we should just walk away from them.

01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:47.130
But Pakistan is important to the region, to
the world and to us, because Pakistan has

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:51.749
100 nuclear warheads, and they’re rushing
to build a lot more. They’ll have more than

01:03:51.749 --> 01:03:57.759
Great Britain sometime in the — in the relatively
near future. They also have the Haqqani network

01:03:57.759 --> 01:04:03.589
and — and the Taliban existent within their
country. And so a — a Pakistan that falls

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:12.519
apart, becomes a 
failed state would be of extraordinary danger

01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:19.069
to Afghanistan and us. And so we’re going
to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan

01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:23.940
to move towards a — a more stable government
and — and rebuild a relationship with us.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.280
And that means that — that — that our
aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.130
have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks
being met.

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:36.270
So for me, I look at this as both a — a
— a need to help move Pakistan in the right

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:42.750
direction and also to get Afghanistan to be
ready. And they will be ready by the end of

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:43.750
2014.

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:44.750
MR. SCHIEFFER: Mr. President.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:50.109
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, when I came into
office, we were still bogged down in Iraq,

01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:55.809
and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.
We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention

01:04:55.809 --> 01:05:00.900
on Afghanistan. And we did deliver a surge
of troops. That was facilitated in part because

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.829
we had ended the war in Iraq.

01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:09.479
And we are now in a position where we have
met many of the objectives that got us there

01:05:09.479 --> 01:05:14.289
in the first place. Part of what had happened
is we’d forgotten why we’d gone. We went

01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:21.119
because there were people who were responsible
for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:27.109
al-Qaida’s core leadership in the border
regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:32.789
We then started to build up Afghan forces.
And we’re now in a position where we can

01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:39.430
transition out, because there’s no reason
why Americans should die when Afghans are

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.249
perfectly capable of defending their own country.

01:05:42.249 --> 01:05:46.680
Now, that transition’s — has to take place
in a responsible fashion. We’ve been there

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:52.819
a long time, and we’ve got to make sure
that we and our coalition partners are pulling

01:05:52.819 --> 01:05:57.779
out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities
that they need.

01:05:57.779 --> 01:06:02.519
But what I think the American people recognize
is after a decade of war, it’s time to do

01:06:02.519 --> 01:06:08.269
some nation-building here at home. And what
we can now do is free up some resources to,

01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:14.589
for example, put Americans back to work, especially
our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges,

01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:20.431
our schools, making sure that, you know, our
veterans are getting the care that they need

01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:26.729
when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder
and traumatic brain injury, making sure that

01:06:26.729 --> 01:06:32.279
the certifications that they need for good
jobs of the future are in place.

01:06:32.279 --> 01:06:38.749
You know, I was having lunch with some — a
veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:42.640
dealing with the most extreme circumstances.
When he came home and he wanted to become

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.910
a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And
what we’ve said is, let’s change those

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:48.910
certifications.

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:51.920
The first lady has done great work with an
organization called Joining Forces putting

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:57.029
our veterans back to work. And as a consequence,
veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower

01:06:57.029 --> 01:07:01.180
than general population, it was higher when
I came into office. So those are the kinds

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.359
of things that we can now do because we’re
making that transition in Afghanistan.

01:07:06.359 --> 01:07:12.739
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right. Let me go to Governor
Romney because you talked about Pakistan and

01:07:12.739 --> 01:07:18.719
what needs to be done there. General Allen,
our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans

01:07:18.719 --> 01:07:26.109
continue to die at the hands of groups who
are supported by Pakistan. We know that Pakistan

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:33.510
has arrested the doctor who helped us catch
Obama’s — bin Laden. It still provides

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:40.210
safe haven for terrorists, yet we continue
to give Pakistan billions of dollars. Is it

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:42.690
time for us to divorce Pakistan?

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:49.540
MR. ROMNEY: No, it’s not time to divorce
a nation on earth that has a hundred nuclear

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:54.910
weapons and is on the way to double that at
some point, a nation that has serious threats

01:07:54.910 --> 01:08:01.249
from terrorist groups within its nation — as
I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani network.

01:08:01.249 --> 01:08:05.119
It’s a nation that’s not like — like
others and that does not have a civilian leadership

01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:06.460
that is calling the shots there.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:11.130
You’ve got the ISI, their intelligence organization
is probably the most powerful of the — of

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:15.109
the three branches there. Then you have the
military and then you have the — the civilian

01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:21.930
government. This is a nation which if it falls
apart — if it becomes a failed state, there

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:26.140
are nuclear weapons there and you’ve got
— you’ve got terrorists there who could

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.380
grab their — their hands onto those nuclear
weapons.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:34.080
This is — this is an important part of the
world for us. Pakistan is — is technically

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.380
an ally, and they’re not acting very much
like an ally right now, but we have some work

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.380
to do.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.130
And I — I don’t blame the administration
for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan

01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:49.900
is strained. We had to go into Pakistan; we
had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.760
That was the right thing to do. And that upset
them, but there was obviously a great deal

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.420
of anger even before that. But we’re going
to have to work with the — with the people

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:03.010
in Pakistan to try and help them move to a
more responsible course than the one that

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:06.350
they’re on. And it’s important for them,
it’s important for the nuclear weapons,

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:12.700
it’s important for the success of Afghanistan,
because inside Pakistan you have a large group

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.970
of Pashtuns that are — that are Taliban,
that they’re going to come rushing back

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:20.470
into Afghanistan when we go. And that’s
one of the reasons the Afghan security forces

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:24.710
have so much work to do to be able to fight
against that. But it’s important for us

01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:29.280
to recognize that we can’t just walk away
from Pakistan. But we do need to make sure

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:35.420
that as we — as we send support for them,
that this is tied to them making progress

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:38.690
on — on matters that would lead them to
becoming a civil society.

01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:43.990
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let me ask you, Governor, because
we know President Obama’s position on this,

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:47.550
what is — what is your position on the use
of drones?

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:52.140
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I believe that we should
use any and all means necessary to take out

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:57.450
people who pose a threat to us and our friends
around the world. And it’s widely reported

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:02.140
that drones are being used in drone strikes,
and I support that entirely and feel the president

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.480
was right to up the usage of that technology
and believe that we should continue to use

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.940
it to continue to go after the people who
represent a threat to this nation and to our

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.940
friends.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.230
Let me also note that, as I said earlier,
we’re going to have to do more than just

01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:20.410
going after leaders and — and killing bad
guys, important as that is. We’re also going

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:26.530
to have to have a far more effective and comprehensive
strategy to help move the world away from

01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:28.830
terror and Islamic extremism.

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:33.040
We haven’t done that yet. We talk a lot
about these things, but you look at the — the

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.870
record. You look at the record of the last
four years and say, is Iran closer to a bomb?

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:46.000
Yes. Is the Middle East in tumult? Yes. Is
— is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.620
No. Is — are Israel and the Palestinians
closer to — to reaching a peace agreement?

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:55.430
No, they haven’t had talks in two years.
We have not seen the progress we need to have,

01:10:55.430 --> 01:11:00.780
and I’m convinced that with strong leadership
and an effort to build a strategy based upon

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:05.310
helping these nations reject extremism, we
can see the kind of peace and prosperity the

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:06.310
world demands.

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:11.620
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, keep in mind our strategy
wasn’t just going after bin Laden. We’ve

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:17.270
created partnerships throughout the region
to deal with extremism — in Somalia, in

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:24.411
Yemen, in Pakistan. And what we’ve also
done is engage these governments in the kind

01:11:24.411 --> 01:11:28.940
of reforms that are actually going to make
a difference in people’s lives day to day,

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:33.690
to make sure that their government aren’t
corrupt, to make sure that they are treating

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:40.940
women with the kind of respect and dignity
that every nation that succeeds has shown,

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.940
and to make sure that they’ve got a free
market system that works.

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:49.440
So across the board, we are engaging them
in building capacity in these countries and

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.500
we have stood on the side of democracy. One
thing I think Americans should be proud of

01:11:54.500 --> 01:12:04.890
— when Tunisians began to protest, this
nation, me, my administration stood with them

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:10.790
earlier than just about any other country.
In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:16.490
In Libya we stood on the side of the people.
And as a consequence there is no doubt that

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:20.100
attitudes about Americans have changed.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:25.170
But there are always going to be elements
in these countries that potentially threaten

01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:26.550
the United States.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:31.520
And we want to shrink those groups and those
networks, and we can do that, but we’re

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.300
always also going to have to maintain vigilance
when it comes to terrorist activities. The

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:41.230
truth, though, is that al-Qaida is much weaker
than it was when I came into office, and they

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:46.260
don’t have the same capacities to attack
the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.260
four years ago.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:53.010
MR. SCHIEFFER: Let’s go to the next segment
because it’s a very important one. It is

01:12:53.010 --> 01:13:00.150
the rise of China and future challenges for
America. I want to just begin this by asking

01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:06.320
both of you — and Mr. President, you go
first this time — what do you believe is

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.840
the greatest future threat to the national
security of this country?

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:17.230
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think it will continue
to be terrorist networks. We have to remain

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:18.790
vigilant, as I just said.

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:25.530
But with respect to China, China’s both
an adversary but also a potential partner

01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:33.090
in the international community if it’s following
the rules. So my attitude coming into office

01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:39.830
was that we are going to insist that China
plays by the same rules as everybody else.

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:46.690
And I know Americans had — had seen jobs
being shipped overseas, businesses and workers

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:51.960
not getting a level playing field when it
came to trade. And that’s the reason why

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:58.970
I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters
when it came to international trade. That’s

01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:05.160
the reason why we have brought more cases
against China for violating trade rules than

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.680
the other — the previous administration
had done in two terms. And we’ve won just

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.770
about every case that we’ve filed, that
— that has been decided. In fact, just recently,

01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:20.160
steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest,
Pennsylvania, are in a position now to sell

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.170
steel to China because we won that case.

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:28.090
We had a tire case in which they were flooding
us with cheap domestic tires — or — or

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:35.130
— or cheap Chinese tires. And we put a stop
to it and, as a consequence, saved jobs throughout

01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:39.950
America. I have to say that Governor Romney
criticized me for being too tough in that

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:45.220
tire case, said this wouldn’t be good for
American workers and that it would be protectionist.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.080
But I tell you, those workers don’t feel
that way. They feel as if they had finally

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.170
an administration who was going to take this
issue seriously.

01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:53.540
Over the long term, in order for us to compete
with China, we’ve also got to make sure,

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.860
though, that we’re taking — taking care
of business here at home. If we don’t have

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:02.600
the best education system in the world, if
we don’t continue to put money into research

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:07.920
and technology that will allow us to — to
create great businesses here in the United

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.080
States, that’s how we lose the competition.
And unfortunately, Governor Romney’s budget

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.580
and his proposals would not allow us to make
those investments.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.580
MR. SCHIEFFER: All right.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.580
Governor.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.020
MR. ROMNEY: Well, first of all, it’s not
government that makes business successful.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:29.190
It’s not government investments that make
businesses grow and hire people.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:35.210
Let me also note that the greatest threat
that the world faces, the greatest national

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:37.900
security threat, is a nuclear Iran.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:44.570
Let’s talk about China. China has an interest
that’s very much like ours in one respect,

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:48.520
and that is they want a stable world. They
don’t want war. They don’t want to see

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.730
protectionism. They don’t want to see the
— the world break out into — into various

01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:57.690
forms of chaos, because they have to — they
have to manufacture goods and put people to

01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:01.760
work. And they have about 20,000 — 20 million,
rather, people coming out of the farms every

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.400
year, coming into the cities, needing jobs.
So they want the economy to work and the world

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.000
to be free and open.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.920
And so we can be a partner with China. We
don’t have to be an adversary in any way,

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:16.480
shape or form. We can work with them. We can
collaborate with them if they’re willing

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.670
to be responsible.

01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:23.060
Now, they look at us and say, is it a good
idea to be with America?

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.990
How strong are we going to be? How strong
is our economy?

01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:29.961
They look at the fact that we owe them a trillion
dollars and owe other people 16 trillion (dollars)

01:16:29.961 --> 01:16:34.460
in total, including them. They — they look
at our — our decision to — to cut back

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:38.950
on our military capabilities — a trillion
dollars. The secretary of defense called these

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:44.300
trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.
It’s not my term. It’s the president’s

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:50.320
own secretary of defense called them devastating.
They look at America’s commitments around

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.360
the world and they see what’s happening
and they say, well, OK, is America going to

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.520
be strong? And the answer is yes. If I’m
president, America will be very strong.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.730
We’ll also make sure that we have trade
relations with China that work for us. I’ve

01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:08.560
watched year in and year out as companies
have shut down and people have lost their

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:14.330
jobs because China has not played by the same
rules, in part by holding down artificially

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:18.580
the value of their currency. It holds down
the prices of their goods. It means our goods

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:22.090
aren’t as competitive and we lose jobs.
That’s got to end.

01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:26.020
They’re making some progress; they need
to make more. That’s why on day one I will

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:31.410
label them a currency manipulator which allows
us to apply tariffs where they’re taking

01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:36.640
jobs. They’re stealing our intellectual
property, our patents, our designs, our technology,

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:41.510
hacking into our computers, counterfeiting
our goods. They have to understand, we want

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:45.790
to trade with them, we want a world that’s
stable, we like free enterprise, but you got

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:46.790
to play by the rules.

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:52.520
MR. SCHIEFFER: Well, Governor, let me just
ask you, if you declare them a currency manipulator

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:58.740
on day one, some people are saying you’re
just going to start a trade war with China

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:03.060
on day one. Is that — isn’t there a risk
that that could happen?

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:07.560
MR. ROMNEY: Well, they sell us about this
much stuff every year. And we sell them about

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:11.940
this much stuff every year. So it’s pretty
clear who doesn’t want a trade war. And

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:16.060
there’s one going on right now that we don’t
know about. It’s a silent one and they’re

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:19.600
winning. We have an enormous trade imbalance
with China. And it’s worse this year than

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.540
last year. And it was worse last year than
the year before.

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:27.810
And — and so we have to understand that
we can’t just surrender and — and lose

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:32.710
jobs year in and year out. We have to say
to our friends in China, look, you guys are

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:36.870
playing aggressively, we understand it, but
— but this can’t keep on going. You can’t

01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:42.580
keep on holding down the value of your currency,
stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:46.030
our products, selling them around the world,
even into the United States.

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:51.260
I was with one company that makes valves in
— in process industries. And they said,

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:55.100
look, we were — we were having some valves
coming in that — that were broken, and we

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.650
had to repair them under warranty. And we
looked them up, and — and they had our serial

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:02.860
number on them. And then we noticed that — that
there was more than one with that same serial

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:07.210
number. They were counterfeit products being
made overseas with the same serial number

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:11.690
as a U.S. company, the same packaging. These
were being sold into our market and around

01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:14.960
the world as if they were made by the U.S.
competitor.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:21.291
This can’t go on. I want a great relationship
with China. China can be our partner. But

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:24.540
— but that doesn’t mean they can just
roll all over us and steal our jobs on an

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.540
unfair basis.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.330
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Governor Romney’s
right. You are familiar with jobs being shipped

01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:33.410
overseas, because you invested in companies
that were shipping jobs overseas. And, you

01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:39.000
know, that’s your right. I mean, that’s
how our free market works.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.280
But I’ve made a different bet on American
workers. You know, if we had taken your advice,

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.100
Governor Romney, about our auto industry,
we’d be buying cars from China instead of

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:54.330
selling cars to China. If we take your advice
with respect to how we change our tax codes

01:19:54.330 --> 01:20:00.750
so that companies that are in profits overseas
don’t pay U.S. taxes compared to companies

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:05.001
here that are paying taxes, now, that’s
estimated to create 800,000 jobs. The problem

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:10.590
is they won’t be here; they’ll be in places
like China. And if we’re not making investments

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:15.940
in education and basic research, which is
not something that the private sector is doing

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.060
at a sufficient pace right now and has never
done, then we will lose the lead in things

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.560
like clean energy technology.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:30.740
Now, with respect to what we’ve done with
China already, U.S. exports have doubled,

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:37.980
since I came into office, to China. And actually,
currencies are at their most advantageous

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:44.380
point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely
have to make more progress, and that’s why

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.830
we’re going to keep on pressing.

01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:50.940
And when it comes to our military and Chinese
security, part of the reason that we were

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:58.390
able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after
having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning

01:20:58.390 --> 01:21:03.330
out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this
is going to be a massive growth area in the

01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:09.340
future. And we believe China can be a partner,
but we’re also sending a very clear signal

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:15.670
that America is a Pacific power, that we are
going to have a presence there. We are working

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:21.290
with countries in the region to make sure,
for example, that ships can pass through,

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:27.480
that commerce continues. And we’re organizing
trade relations with countries other than

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:32.690
China so that China starts feeling more pressure
about meeting basic international standards.

01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:35.960
That’s the kind of leadership we’ve shown
in the region. That’s the kind of leadership

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:36.960
that we’ll continue to show.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:43.190
MR. ROMNEY: I just want to take one of those
points. Again, attacking me is not talking

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:48.270
about an agenda for getting more trade and
opening up more jobs in this country. But

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:52.600
the president mentioned the auto industry
and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.810
being elsewhere. Nothing could be further
from the truth. I’m a son of Detroit. I

01:21:56.810 --> 01:22:02.830
was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a
car company. I like American cars. And I would

01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:08.570
do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.
My plan to get the industry on its feet when

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:12.980
it was in real trouble was not to start writing
checks. It was President Bush that wrote the

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:16.560
first checks. I disagree with that. I said
they need — these companies need to go through

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.940
a managed bankruptcy, and in that process
they can get government help and government

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.840
guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy
to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.850
that they’d — they’d built up.

01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:29.750
And fortunately the president picked —

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:30.750
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor Romney, that’s
not what you said.

01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:33.000
MR. ROMNEY: Fortunately, the president — you
can take — you can take a look at the op-ed.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor, you did not —

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
MR. ROMNEY: You can take a look at the op-ed.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You did not say that you
would provide, Governor, help.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
MR. ROMNEY: You know, I’m — I’m still
speaking. I said that we would provide guarantees

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.300
and — and that was what was able to allow
these companies to go through bankruptcy,

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.710
to come out of bankruptcy. Under no circumstances
would I do anything other than to help this

01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:47.420
industry get on its feet. And the idea that
has been suggested that I would liquidate

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.440
the industry — of course not. Of course
not.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.530
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let’s check the record.

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:52.790
MR. ROMNEY: That’s the height of silliness.

01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:54.050
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let’s — let’s check
the record.

01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:58.141
MR. ROMNEY: I have never said I would — I
would liquidate the industry. I want to keep

01:22:58.141 --> 01:22:59.141
the industry growing and thriving.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:00.141
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor, the people in Detroit
don’t forget.

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:05.350
MR. ROMNEY: And — and that’s I have the
kind of commitment to make sure that our industries

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:10.390
in this country can compete and be successful.
We in this country can compete successfully

01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:15.130
with anyone in the world. And we’re going
to. We’re going to have to have a president,

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:18.950
however, that doesn’t think that somehow
the government investing in — in car companies

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:23.950
like Tesla and — and Fisker, making electric
battery cars — this is not research, Mr.

01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:29.280
President. These are the government investing
in companies, investing in Solyndra. This

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:34.161
is a company. This isn’t basic research.
I — I want to invest in research. Research

01:23:34.161 --> 01:23:39.290
is great. Providing funding to universities
and think tanks — great. But investing in

01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:42.380
companies? Absolutely not. That’s the wrong
way to go.

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:43.380
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor, the fact of the
matter is —

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.380
MR. ROMNEY: I’m still speaking.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.380
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well — (chuckles) —

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.030
MR. ROMNEY: So I want to make sure that we
make — we make America more competitive

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:48.030
—

01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:49.030
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.

01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:51.480
MR. ROMNEY: — and that we do those things
that make America the most attractive place

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.490
in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators,
businesses to grow. But your investing in

01:23:56.490 --> 01:24:00.460
companies doesn’t do that. In fact it makes
it less likely for them to come here —

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.460
PRESIDENT OBAMA: All right, Governor —

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.560
MR. ROMNEY: — because the private sector’s
not going to invest in a — in a — in a

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:04.560
solar company if —

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.560
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I’m happy — I’m — I’m
— I’m happy to respond —

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.390
MR. ROMNEY: — if you’re investing government
money and someone else’s.

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:11.440
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You’ve held the floor for
a while. The — look, I think anybody out

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:17.860
there can check the record. Governor Romney,
you keep on trying to, you know, airbrush

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:18.860
history here.

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:27.560
You were very clear that you would not provide
government assistance to the U.S. auto companies

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.790
even if they went through bankruptcy. You
said that they could get it in the private

01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:34.270
marketplace. That wasn’t true. They would
have gone through a —

01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:35.330
MR. ROMNEY: You’re wrong. You’re wrong,
Mr. President.

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:36.330
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I — no, I am not wrong.

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:37.330
MR. ROMNEY: You’re wrong.

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:38.330
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I am not wrong. And —

01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:39.330
MR. ROMNEY: People can look it up. You’re
right.

01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:40.330
PRESIDENT OBAMA: People will look it up.

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:41.330
MR. ROMNEY: Good.

01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:43.840
PRESIDENT OBAMA: But more importantly, it
is true that in order for us to be competitive,

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.400
we’re going to have to make some smart choices
right now. Cutting our education budget — that’s

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.390
not a smart choice. That will not help us
compete with China. Cutting our investments

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:58.580
in research and technology — that’s not
a smart choice. That will not help us compete

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:07.170
with China. Bringing down (sic) our deficit
by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military

01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:11.440
spending that our military’s not asking
for before we even get to the debt that we

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.170
currently have — that is not going to make
us more competitive. Those are the kinds of

01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:21.590
choices that the American people face right
now. Having a tax code that rewards companies

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:25.450
that are shipping jobs overseas instead of
companies that are investing here in the United

01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:28.990
States — that will not make us more competitive.

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:34.610
And — and the one thing that I’m absolutely
clear about is that after a decade in which

01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:41.030
we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas,
nobody championing American workers and American

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:45.230
businesses, we’ve now begun to make some
real progress. What we can’t do is go back

01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:52.560
to the same policies that got us into such
difficulty in the first place. And that’s

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.210
why we have to move forward and not go back.

01:25:54.210 --> 01:25:58.190
MR. ROMNEY: I couldn’t agree more about
going forward, but I certainly don’t want

01:25:58.190 --> 01:26:02.730
to go back to the policies of the last four
years. The policies of the last four years

01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:07.520
have seen incomes in America decline every
year for middle-income families, now down

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:14.781
$4,300 during your term, 23 million Americans
still struggling to find a good job. When

01:26:14.781 --> 01:26:19.610
you came into office, 32 million people on
food stamps — today 47 million people on

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:20.890
food stamps.

01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:27.060
When you came to office, just over $10 trillion
in debt — now $16 trillion in debt. It hasn’t

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:32.730
worked. You said by now we’d be at 5.4 percent
unemployment. We’re 9 million jobs short

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:38.060
of that. I’ve met some of those people.
I’ve met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.050
— I met a young woman in — in — in Philadelphia
who’s coming out of — out of college,

01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:46.580
can’t find work. I’ve been — Ann was
with someone just the other day that was just

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:51.450
weeping about not being able to get work.
It’s just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:55.000
as ours that these last four years have been
so hard.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.070
And that — and that’s why it’s so critical
that we make America once again the most attractive

01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:04.600
place in the world to start businesses, to
build jobs, to grow the economy. And that’s

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.920
not going to happen by — by just hiring
teachers. Look, I — I love to — I love

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.670
teachers, and I’m happy to have states and
communities that want to hire teachers, do

01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:16.670
that. I — by the way, I don’t like to
have the federal government start pushing

01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:20.710
its way deeper and deeper into — into our
schools. Let the states and localities do

01:27:20.710 --> 01:27:22.960
that. I was a governor. The federal government
didn’t hire our teachers.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.960
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor —

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:27.300
MR. ROMNEY: But I love teachers. But I want
to get our private sector growing, and I know

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.300
how to do it.

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:32.980
MR. SCHIEFFER: I think we all love teachers.
(Laughter.) Gentlemen, thank you so much for

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:38.280
a very vigorous debate. We have come to the
end. It is time for closing statements. I

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.560
believe you’re first, Mr. President.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.440
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, thank you very much
Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:50.520
You know, you’ve now heard three debates,
months of campaigning and way too many TV

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.920
commercials. (Laughter.) And now you’ve
got a choice. You know, over the last four

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:02.530
years, we’ve made real progress digging
our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged

01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:07.220
wars, record deficits and the worst economic
crisis since the Great Depression.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:12.760
And Governor Romney wants to take us back
to those policies: a foreign policy that’s

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:18.230
wrong and reckless; economic policies that
won’t create jobs, won’t reduce our deficit,

01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:23.030
but will make sure that folks at the very
top don’t have to play by the same rules

01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:24.030
that you do.

01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:29.251
And I’ve got a different vision for America.
I want to build on our strengths. And I put

01:28:29.251 --> 01:28:35.500
forward a plan to make sure that we’re bringing
manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:40.020
companies and small businesses that are investing
here not overseas. I want to make sure we’ve

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:44.650
got the best education system in the world
and we’re retraining our workers for the

01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:45.720
jobs of tomorrow.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:52.280
I want to control our own energy by developing
oil and natural gas, but also the energy sources

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.310
of the future. Yes, I want to reduce our deficit
by cutting spending that we don’t need,

01:28:57.310 --> 01:29:02.260
but also by asking the wealthy to do a little
bit more so that we can invest in things like

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:07.540
research and technology that are the key to
a 21st century economy.

01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:11.640
As commander in chief, I will maintain the
strongest military in the world, keep faith

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:19.250
with our troops and go after those who would
do us harm. But after a decade of war, I think

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:22.750
we all recognize we got to do some nation
building here at home, rebuilding our roads,

01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:27.420
our bridges and especially caring for our
veterans who’ve sacrificed so much for our

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.420
freedom.

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:34.080
You know, we’ve been through tough times,
but we always bounce back because of our character,

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.920
because we pull together. And if I have the
privilege of being your president for another

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.850
four years, I promise you I will always listen
to your voices, I will fight for your families

01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:47.190
and I will work every single day to make sure
that America continues to be the greatest

01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:48.990
nation on earth. Thank you.

01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:50.310
MR. SCHIEFFER: Governor.

01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:55.090
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Bob, Mr. President,
folks at Lynn University — good to be with

01:29:55.090 --> 01:30:01.710
you. I’m optimistic about the future. I’m
excited about our prospects as a nation. I

01:30:01.710 --> 01:30:06.370
want to see peace. I want to see growing peace
in this country, it’s our objective. We

01:30:06.370 --> 01:30:10.490
have an opportunity to have real leadership.
America’s going to have that kind of leadership

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:15.840
and continue to promote principles of peace
that’ll make a world the safer place and

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.400
make people in this country more confident
that their future is secure.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.680
I also want to make sure that we get this
economy going. And there are two very different

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.340
paths the country can take. One is a path
represented by the president, which, at the

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:33.950
end of four years, would mean we’d have
$20 trillion in debt, heading towards Greece.

01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:38.700
I’ll get us on track to a balanced budget.
The president’s path will mean continuing

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:43.440
declining in take-home pay. I want to make
sure our take-home pay turns around and starts

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:49.110
to grow. The president’s path means 20 million
people out of work struggling for a good job.

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:53.650
I’ll get people back to work with 12 million
new jobs. I’m going to make sure that we

01:30:53.650 --> 01:30:58.870
get people off of food stamps not by cutting
the program but by getting them good jobs.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:03.050
America’s going to come back. And for that
to happen, we’re going to have to have a

01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:08.160
president who can work across the aisle. I
was in a state where my legislature was 87

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.840
percent Democrat. I learned how to get along
on the other side of the aisle. We’ve got

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:18.010
to do that in Washington. Washington is broken.
I know what it takes to get this country back.

01:31:18.010 --> 01:31:20.110
And we’ll work with good Democrats and good
Republicans to do that.

01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:23.070
This nation is the hope of the earth. We’ve
been blessed by having a nation that’s free

01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:27.260
and prosperous thanks to the contributions
of the Greatest Generation. They’ve held

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:32.510
a torch for the world to see, the torch of
freedom and hope and opportunity. Now it’s

01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:37.650
our turn to take that torch. I’m convinced
we’ll do it. We need strong leadership.

01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:42.840
I’d like to be that leader, with your support.
I’ll work with you. I’ll lead you in an

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:52.560
open and honest way. And I ask for your vote.
I’d like to be the next president of the

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.950
United States to support and help this great
nation, and to make sure that we all together

01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:59.990
maintain America as the hope of the earth.
Thank you so much.

01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:05.360
MR. SCHIEFFER: Gentlemen, thank you both so
much. That brings an end to this year’s

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.440
debates. And we want to thank Lynn University
and its students for having us. As I always

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:15.890
do at the end of these debates, I leave you
with the words of my mom who said, go vote.

01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:48.380
It makes you feel big and strong.

01:32:48.380 --> 01:33:49.980
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That’s great.

01:33:49.980 --> 01:34:51.590
MR. SCHIEFFER: Good night.

01:34:51.590 --> 01:35:53.190
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you.
