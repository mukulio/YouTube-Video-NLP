00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.649
BOB SCHIEFFER: Good evening from the campus
of Lynn University here in Boca Raton, Florida.

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.960
This is the fourth and last debate of the
2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.340
on Presidential Debates. This one’s on foreign
policy. I’m Bob Schieffer of CBS News. The

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.970
questions are mine, and I have not shared
them with the candidates or their aides.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.350
The audience has taken a vow of silence — no
applause, no reaction of any kind except right

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:52.350
now when we welcome President Barack Obama
and Governor Mitt Romney. (Sustained cheers,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:09.300
applause.) Gentlemen, your campaigns have
agreed to certain rules and they are simple.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.070
They have asked me to divide the evening into
segments. I’ll pose a question at the beginning

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.900
of each segment. You will each have two minutes
to respond, and then we will have a general

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.610
discussion until we move to the next segment.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.880
Tonight’s debate, as both of your know,
comes on the 50th anniversary of the night

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.340
that President Kennedy told the world that
the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.340
in Cuba — perhaps the closest we’ve ever
come to nuclear war. And it is a sobering

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.630
reminder that every president faces at some
point an unexpected threat to our national

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.810
security from abroad. So let’s begin.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.210
The first segment is the challenge of a changing
Middle East and the new face of terrorism.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.990
I’m going to put this into two segments,
so you’ll have two topic questions within

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:10.189
this one segment on that subject. The first
question, and it concerns Libya, the controversy

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:15.730
over what happened there continues. Four Americans
are dead, including an American ambassador.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.730
Questions remain. What happened? What caused
it? Was it spontaneous?

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.349
Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy
failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.829
about what really happened?

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.920
Governor Romney, you said this was an example
of an American policy in the Middle East that

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.519
is unraveling before our very eyes. I’d
like to hear each of you give your thoughts

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.870
on that.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.999
Governor Romney, you won the toss. You go
first.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.739
MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Bob, and thank you
for agreeing to moderate this debate this

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.980
evening. Thank you to Lynn University for
welcoming us here, and Mr. President, it’s

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.849
good to be with you again. We were together
at a humorous event a little earlier, and

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.430
it’s nice to maybe be funny this time not
on purpose. We’ll see what happens. (Laughter.)

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.089
This is obviously an area of great concern
to the entire world and to America in particular,

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:13.730
which is to see a — a complete change in
the — the — the structure and the — the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.370
environment in the Middle East. With the Arab
Spring came a great deal of hope that there

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.900
would be a change towards more moderation
and opportunity for greater participation

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.800
on the part of women and — and public life
and in economic life in the Middle East. But

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.529
instead we’ve seen in nation after nation
a number of disturbing events. Of course,

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:40.129
we see in Syria 30,000 civilians having been
killed by the military there. We see in — in

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.269
— in Libya an attack apparently by — well,
I think we know now by terrorists of some

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.040
kind against — against our people there,
four people dead. Our hearts and minds go

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.819
to them. Mali has been taken over, the northern
part of Mali, by al-Qaida-type individuals.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.279
We have in — in Egypt a Muslim Brotherhood
president.

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.749
And so what we’re seeing is a — a — a
pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.620
we had for that region. Of course, the greatest
threat of all is Iran, four years closer to

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.869
a nuclear weapon. And — and we’re going
to have to recognize that we have to do as

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:18.319
the president has done. I congratulate him
on — on taking out Osama bin Laden and going

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.150
after the leadership in al-Qaida. But we can’t
kill our way out of this mess. We’re — we’re

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.960
going to have to put in place a very comprehensive
and robust strategy to help the — the world

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.910
of Islam and — and other parts of the world
reject this radical violent extremism which

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.289
is — it’s really not on the run. It’s
certainly not hiding. This is a group that

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.129
is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and
it presents an enormous threat to our friends,

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.349
to the world, to America long term, and we
must have a comprehensive strategy to help

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.280
reject this kind of extremism.
